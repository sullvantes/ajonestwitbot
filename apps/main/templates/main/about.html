        <h3>About</h3> site has been created to expand my coding skills and mess with twitter folks. Equal parts education, humor and anti-fascism. 
        <br><br> Alex Jones is a ridiculous clown. He is the showrunner and creator of InfoWars. I hope we follow eachother to have a good time and follow Trump Supporters to confuse them. 
        <br><br>
        In the near future, I may create a similar site that tweets back affirmative articles that provide counterpoints to the fascist thought and truly fake news that is so prevalent on the internet. <a href="{% url 'home:counterpoint'">Click here</a> if you are interested in that so i can count your support.
